* Great organization of the event by Hackbright and OpenHatch
* All the participants were amazing! Very open and active learners, both willing to try out new things and have speak up if they are caught or confused
* The two day format helped solidify the knowledge base for participants and make the whole experience less rushed


PS: The cupcake break was the best idea
